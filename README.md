# 🎬 Netflix Content Strategy Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix’s content dataset to uncover insights about **viewership patterns**, **content types**, and **global reach**.  
Using **Python** and data science libraries, it explores what drives audience engagement and builds a **predictive model** to estimate viewing hours based on key features.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze trends between **Movies** and **Shows** based on viewership.  
- Evaluate how **global availability** impacts audience reach.  
- Identify patterns by **language** and **release year**.  
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict viewership hours.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- 📈 Shows tend to receive **higher average viewership** than movies.  
- 🌍 Content **available globally** performs significantly better.  
- 🗓️ **Newer releases** generally attract more viewers.  
- 🗣️ Language diversity contributes to platform engagement.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Imported dataset, handled missing values, standardized column names.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extracted year from release dates and encoded categorical data.  
4. **Predictive Modeling** – Built regression models using Scikit-learn Pipelines.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Measured performance and analyzed feature importance.
