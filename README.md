📊 Netflix Content Strategy Analysis
🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes Netflix content data to uncover insights about viewing patterns, content types, and global reach. Using data visualization and predictive modeling, it identifies factors influencing viewership and helps guide data-driven content strategy decisions.

🎯 Objectives

Understand which content types (Movies or Shows) attract more viewers.

Explore the impact of global availability on viewership.

Identify trends based on language and release year.

Build a predictive model to estimate viewing hours based on content features.

🧠 Key Insights

Shows generally receive higher viewership than movies.

Globally available content performs significantly better.

Release year and language have notable influence on viewership trends.

🧰 Skills & Tools Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Machine Learning, Linear Regression, One-Hot Encoding, Pipeline Building, Model Evaluation, Predictive Modeling

⚙️ Workflow

Data Loading & Cleaning – Loaded the dataset, handled missing values, and standardized column names.

Exploratory Data Analysis – Visualized distributions and patterns in content type, availability, and hours viewed.

Feature Engineering – Extracted release year and encoded categorical variables.

Predictive Modeling – Built and trained a regression model using Scikit-learn pipelines.

Model Evaluation – Evaluated model performance and interpreted key feature importances.

📈 Results

The model highlighted content type and global availability as top predictors of viewership.

Data-driven insights can support Netflix’s content acquisition and marketing strategies.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add genre and synopsis-based text analysis using NLP.

Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Integrate external datasets like IMDb ratings or social media trends.
